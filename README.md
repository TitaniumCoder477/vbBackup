# vbBackup.sh
vbBackup is a really application for backing up (technically exporting) VirtualBox VMs. It can backup all VMs or a selection list or individual VMs. It can skip or stop-start VMs that are running.

Hints:
- Create a vbBackupList.txt in the program folder and add your specific VMs there. Anything beginning with a # is skipped.
- Some features are not available yet, such as retention
